### How to:
You can select the scene from 'Assets/Scenes'. Once in the scene, you can hit play to see the simulation. You can change some settings in the script from the MANAGER GameObject.

### Settings:
**Single-thread:**
- Particle count
- Particle parameters*

**ECS, Job system:**
- Particle count
You can find the particle parameters* inside 'Assets/Job System/Prefabs' in the SPHSphereECS GameObject.


* Particle parameters:
  - radius
  - smoothing radius
  - rest density
  - gravity multiplier
  - mass
  - viscosity
  - drag
